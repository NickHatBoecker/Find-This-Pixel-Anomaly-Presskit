In Find This Pixel Anomaly your task involves monitoring real-time surveillance camera feeds. Identify any irregularities within the monitored areas. These anomalies can vary from missing furniture to cute visitors.

Found an anomaly? File a report and hope it will get fixed in time. Otherwise you will get in trouble, because too many anomalies will end the game.

ANOMALIES
===========

Each map contains 20 individual anomalies and 3 recurring anomalies. Every playthrough is unique because the anomalies are randomly placed.

EXTRA OBJECT

Wait, was this chair here before? Who put it there? Well, it doesn't matter because you should hurry up and file a report. Some items are obvious, but the devil is in the details.

INTRUDER

They may look cute, but these creatures are up to no good. They are masters of disguise so keep an eye on them.

IMAGE

A picture is worth a thousand words. But 1000 words won't save you either. Look out for paintings, signs and posters.

MISSING OBJECT

Is there something missing here or are you just paranoid? Whenever an object is swallowed by the ground, file a report.

THERE ARE MORE TYPES OF ANOMALIES

But nothing beats a little secret. Can you find all of them?
